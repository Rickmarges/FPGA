# FPGA
This repostitory is used for the major Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) at NHL Stenden Hogeschool.
For the major we'll have to make our own project.

## Idea
Our idea is to create an FPGA who's able to play the Google Chrome's Dino jump game on it's own. <br>
Therefore we'll need a screen for the input or a camera to register the bushes and birds. <br>
We also need some connection to the computer/laptop on which it is playing for the FPGA to make commands to jump.

## Schedule
In this section we'll talk about the schedule for the major.
We'll keep this as up-to-date as possible.
